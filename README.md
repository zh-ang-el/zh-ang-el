## Hello there!

I'm Angelina Zhang, an aspiring SWE and second year CS major at Northeastern University. This spring I'm looking for a software related co-op, such as frontend, backend, devops, QA, etc. I'm interested in building things for social good, and learning through doing. 

Kotlin is my favorite language, and I love free/open source software and latte art!
